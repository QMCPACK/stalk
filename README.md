# Surrogate Theory Accelerated Line-search Kit (STALK)

Surrogate Theory Accelerated Line-search Kit (STALK) is a Python implementation of The
Surrogate Hessian Accelerated Parallel Line-search method. The method is intended for
optimizing and performing energy minimization of atomic structures in the presence of
statistical noise.
